# Waves
Waves has two goals to incentivize productivity to everyone for free and help end plastic pollution in our oceans by providing resources to nonprofit cleanups for free.

# Stick to MVP
- Your North Star is your working MVP. Every additional feature: Q: is it part of MVP?
- Get to iteration and market testing asap
- scope creep 

# List of Potential Stretch Goals:
- Tap for adding
- Gesture movement instead of navigation bar based
- Sharing to some sort of messaging app (e.g. email, messages, etc)
